# Mini-Assignment#1
## Short note on various options in common compilers: GCC and LLVM.
GCC and LLVM contain several options such as “Preprocessor options”,“stage selection options”, “Optimisation options”, and so on.
Lets see some of the main options:
1) -include <filename>: is a “preprocessor option”. This option is supported by both GCC and LLVM. This command executes (#include”filename”) before executing the source code.
ex:
///////////////////////////////
A.cpp:
    ```
    #include<iostream>           
    using namespace std;           
        int main(){
            cout<< i ;
            return 0;
            }
    ```
    ///////////////////////////////////
        B.cpp
    ```
            #include<iostream>
            int i=199;
    ```
    /////////////////////////////////
On console:
GCC:                        
$ g++ A.cpp -include B.cpp   
$ ./a.out               
199            

LLVM:
$ clang++ A.cpp -include B.cpp
$ ./a.out
199

2) -E: is a stage selection option. This option is supported by both GCC and LLVM. This command  stops the execution of the program after the preprocessor stage and displays the output of the preprocessor on the console.
ex: //////////////////////////////////////////////////
On console:
GCC:                        
$ g++ A.cpp -E                
// preprocessor output       
$
LLVM:
$ clang++ A.cpp -E
// preprocessor output 
$
/////////////////////////////////////////////////
3) -c: is a stage selection option. This option is supported by both GCC and LLVM. This command stops the program after the assembler stage and produces a  .o object file.
4) -S: is a stage selection option.This option is supported by both GCC and LLVM. This command stops the program before the assembler stage and produces a  .s file(written in assembly language).
ex:////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
On console:
GCC:                        
$ g++ A.cpp -c               
$ g++ A.cpp -S              
LLVM:
$ clang++ A.cpp -c
$ clang++ A.cpp -S
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Two files named A.o(not readable) and A.s(in assembly language) will be created.
5) -Os: is an optimisation option. This option is supported by both GCC and LLVM. This command optimises the final executable code by reducing its size and also increases performance.
ex: //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
On console:
    GCC:                   
    $ g++ A.cpp -Oz           
    $ g++ A.cpp -o b           
    LLVM:
    $ clang++ A.cpp -Oz
    $ clang++ A.cpp -o b
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
The size of the executable file “a.out”(produced using -Oz option) is 17184Bytes.
The size of the executable file “b” is 17280Bytes.

## Note on the various frontends that these compilers support.
GCC and LLVM support various frontends for the programming languages.
1) GCC provides:
 “gcc” as a frontend for language “C”    
 “g++” as a frontend for language “C++”    
 “GFortran” as a frontend for language “Fortran”
 “Ada” as a frontend for language “GNAT”
 “GHDL” as a frontend for a hardware design language “VHDL”
2) LLVM provides:
 “clang” as a frontend for languages “C and C++” 
 “llgo” as a frontend for language “Go”
 “flang” as a frontend for language “Fortran”

Let's take a simple program “addition.cpp” and generate codes of various architectures  for this program.
addition.cpp:
```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int a=10,b=20;
    cout<<a+b;
    return 0;
}
```
Information regarding the generated codes of various architecture:
By GCC compiler:
1) The executable file written in x86-64 architecture takes 1.987 sec for converting into executable file, occupies a space of 33745 B and 0.547 sec to get executed.
2) The executable file written in ARM32 architecture takes 2.625 sec for converting into executable file, occupies a space of 1,03,162 B and 1.161 sec to get executed.
3) The executable file written in ARM64 architecture takes 3.450 sec for converting into executable file, occupies a space of 32768B and 1.799 sec to get executed.

By LLVM compiler:
1) The executable file written in x86-64 architecture takes 2.201 sec for converting into executable file, occupies a space of 3,30,818 B and 0.802 sec to get executed.
2) The executable file written in ARM32 architecture takes 2.289 sec for converting into executable file, occupies a space of 30,112 B and 0.976 sec to get executed.
3) The executable file written in ARM64 architecture takes 2.429 sec for converting into executable file, occupies a space of 3,36,452B and 1.077 sec to get executed.

Conclusion:
1) The ease of converting a source into various architectures using GCC compiler : x-86 > ARM32 > ARM64
2) The ease of converting a source into various architectures using LLVM compiler : x-86 > ARM32 > ARM64
3) The ease of executing the executable files written in various architectures using : x-86 > ARM32 > ARM64

## Ans4)
Optimising options are used to optimise the source code in some areas like faster compilation or low memory consumption etc..
An optimising option that optimises a code in a particular area may de-optimise some other areas.
There were several optimising options, but our main concern is on “O0,O1,O2,O3,Os,Oz”. 
Oz optimisation option doesn’t work with GCC compiler but only works with LLVM compiler.
I have taken a larger code as assumption because in smaller codes there won't be more chance to optimise it. 
I considered the source code as the worst case scenario of bubble sort algo : 
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Bubblesorting.cpp
```
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
void bubblesort(int* arr)
{
    int i=0,j=0,k=0,t=0;
    for(i=0;i<1000;i++)
    {
        k=i;
        while(k-1>=0)
        {
            if(arr[k-1]>arr[k])
            {
                t=arr[k-1];
                arr[k-1]=arr[k];
                arr[k]=t;
                k--;
            }
            else
                break;
        }
    }
}
int main()
{
    int  arr[1000];
    for(int i=0;i<1000;i++)
    arr[i]=1000-i;
    bubblesort(arr);
    return 0;
}
```

Let’s compile this program in GCC and LLVM compiler as:
```
GCC: $ g++ Bubblesorting.cpp -Oi (i=0,1,2,3,s,z)
     $ time ./a.out   (to get the time taken to execute)
LLVM: $ clang++ Bubblesorting.cpp -Oi (i=0,1,2,3,s,z)
         $ time ./a.out   (to get the time taken to execute)
```
Observations: (The observations are an average of 5 values)
    **(The time values are calculated using time ./a.out command)
    Time taken for GCC with-out optimisation levels : 181.4 msec
    Time taken for GCC with optimisation level O0 : 179.2 msec
    Time taken for GCC with optimisation level O1 : 85.4 msec
    Time taken for GCC with optimisation level O2 : 84.8 msec
    Time taken for GCC with optimisation level O3 : 5.2 msec
    Time taken for GCC with optimisation level Os : 71.2 msec

Time taken for LLVM with-out optimisation levels : 177.4 msec
Time taken for LLVM with optimisation level O0 : 173.4 msec
Time taken for LLVM with optimisation level O1 : 81.8 msec
Time taken for LLVM with optimisation level O2 : 48.4 msec
Time taken for LLVM with optimisation level O3 : 48.0 msec
Time taken for LLVM with optimisation level Os : 76.0 msec
Time taken for LLVM with optimisation level Oz : 81.8 msec

Conclusion:
The code optimisation powers of the optimisation levels are as : O3 > O2 > O1 > O0 > without optimising levels
The compiler where optimising occurs at faster rate using the optimising options: GCC > LLVM
